Vapour Lab is a javascript library for filter unit calculations based on the latest engineering and science sourced from papers like [Characterizing the performance of a do-it-yourself (DIY) box fan air filter](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02786826.2022.2054674).

[See example.js](https://github.com/TheMemeticist/Vapour-Lab/blob/main/js/example.js) on usage for estimating CR-Boxes given a space. Then you can add or reference the library in your site.
